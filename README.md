# Companionship-Network
This is a repository for a closer inspection of the renowned network for accompaniment.

### Install  
The code relies mostly on python native packages, it only needs ```pandas``` to create the network and ```networkx``` to execute everything. We **recommend using Anaconda**, as everything necessary is already installed in there, otherwise these packages can be manually installed by executing the following command:  
```$ pip install pandas networkx```  
Note: Pip has to be Version ```pip>=19.3``` to be able to install pandas from pip.

### Usage
To execute the code navigate into the ```src``` folder and execute the following command:  
```$ python run.py```  
  
For more output, verbose mode can be switched on like so:  
```$ python run.py -v```
